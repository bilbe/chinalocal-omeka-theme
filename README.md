# Harvard DH Omeka Theme
This is a theme for Omeka developed for use in the Harvard History Department. It's based on the 
[Berlin](https://github.com/omeka/theme-berlin) theme, but with significant alterations for our own use.

To use it, you can just clone the repository into the themes directory of your Omeka site, or download and 
unpack the zip file through GitHub.
